# Building Your Own Lab
## Introduction
Building your own lab is important for a lot of reasons, but most importantly it is fun and teaches you a bunch of valuable information. In this section we will do some work securing our daily lives and install a virtual machine for us to work on. What you will be making is uniquely yours and will be something that you will work on and refine for the rest of your time doing the computers. This is your new workbench/hangout spot, so take pride in what you are making and make it yours.

## Virtualization
Why do we use virtualization?

Read [https://www.vmware.com/solutions/virtualization.html](https://www.vmware.com/solutions/virtualization.html)

Write up a few sentences on the primary benefits of running a virtualized environment inside of your Windows machine.

## Installing Ubuntu in VMWare

Install free virtualization software to run your virtual machine in! 

I recommend vmware player, as that has been what I have always used, however there are many alternatives, primarily VirtualBox and QEMU.

**NOTE: If you already have one of these two installed, use them if you don't want to download an extra program to your computer. It will slightly change your experience, but everything that happens inside the VM will remain the same so it will not hurt your ability to learn.**

This should be very straightforward. When you are complete, submit a screenshot of VMWare (or whatever you decided to use). Use the Microsoft 'Snip' tool to forever change your screenshot game. Just type "Snip" into the search bar and it will appear.

## Install Ubuntu

Install the Linux operating system Ubuntu using your virtualization software of choice! If you already have a VM with a Linux image on it, you don't need to download a new one just for this course. It will not change any aspect of your experience and there is no need to waste time or space. 

An image is what we refer to an Operating System when packaged into a format that can be run off of a disc, usually having a .iso extension. We can download .iso's and boot off of the disc, but it's generally easier to use a VM.

I could give you more information on what to do for this, but there are a ton of tutorials and youtube videos out there. Should be an easy google, and the information doesn't change too much. Let us know if you have any problems, but I recommend going step by step through a tutorial. This is your first challenge that we are telling you to figure it out yourself.

We always try to link to the source of things, even dank memes. It's a weird thing to care about, but the internet makes it so easy to repost images without any way of crediting the author, and they're producing content so might as well throw them a follow. 

When you're done, submit a screenshot of you running the Linux VM.

## Install VMWare Tools
Your VM might have automatically done this for you, or perhaps your guide had you did this. If not, you need to install VMWare Tools for Ubuntu. If you are not using VMWare, skip this.

You need this for a lot of critical usability things, and it doesn't come pre-installed. You have most likely already seen prompts telling you to do this. Do it. I'll be honest, this can be kinda difficult sometimes, but you gotta figure your own way through this. Again, if you have any trouble, and this takes more than a half hour to figure out, call someone over or message us and we will help you out. There is no shame, I've had VMs before that I gave up trying to install VMWare tools and just sucked it up for a week. You'll be on this VM for a while, so you need to get it installed.

When complete, submit a screenshot that shows VMWaretools installed.

## What is sudo?

Tasks:
1. What the heck is sudo? sudo <https://www.lifewire.com/ubuntu-sudo-2205669>. Submit what sudo is.

## Make it Yours
Now you need to make this house a home, have fun with it. This is a random smattering of things that I highly recommend you do, both for quality of life and for getting accustomed to how things work.

1. Change Wallpaper
2. Install Google Chrome
3. Install Unity Tweak Tool and do something interesting
4. Install VLC Media Player
5. Install GIMP and make me a meme. Post your meme in the Slack.
